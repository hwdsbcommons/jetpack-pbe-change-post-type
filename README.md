# jetpack-pbe-change-post-type
This plugin changes a post sent by Jetpack's post by email functionality to the Presentation post-type.

This allows users to post to the presentations created by this plugin: https://github.com/cgrymala/reveal-js-presentations

It also sets the post taxonomy (Presentation) to "announcements" so that the post lands in the presentation relevant to our uses.
